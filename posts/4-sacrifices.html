          <p>Michelangelo used to say: "The sculpture is already in the rock", meaning that you only have to remove what is not important. I honestly like to think that way, we do not have to do more things, we have to do less.</p>

        <h2>Less is more</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>As you saw, the one who can do the most,and knows more is the one who gets more money. So knowledge is what can make your time be worth gold or even diamonds, you just have to invest it in yourself, learning more useful things so you can add value to the world, the more you learn, the more you will be able to do, and with every thing that you do, you could be helping people in our society, and by helping people is how you can get money, if you can help 1 million people in the world, you will probably can get $1 million dollars or even more.</p>
        <h2>Create a routine</h2>
        <p>If you know what you have to do, it will be less easy for you to waste your time, at least you will feel guilty and know that's wrong, and believe me, that's a good thing if you use it to stop wasting your time. Also, when you are creating a routine you should think if those things that you are putting on it are really important, and are really worth your time, besides you could find ways to optimize the way you are spending it, because think about it, does drinking a cup of coffee in that café 10 blocks away from your house is really worth it? Remember that TIME IS GOLD.</p>
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>After defining what you want to do everyday, follow that plan, that routine, everyday; that's the way you start making progress, putting a little brick everyday, so you can get that castle at some point. Brick by brick you won't feel like you are doing a lot of effort, but you are, and trust me, after 1000 days putting bricks you will see how big your castle is, and if you continue, it will be even greater.</p>
        <h2>Nobody will cheer you for putting a brick</h2>
        <p>Would you make a post of you spending three hours learning how to code everyday? it is repetitive, people will get tired of that like three days later; the same for you eating those ugly vegetables; boring, boring, boring; even though, those are the things that will give you an amazing skillset and an astonishing body respectively, so you sometimes will feel like it's not important, but that is only your brain's reward system who is really outdated not realizing what the modern era needs are.</p>
        <p>You can always find ways to make those things enjoyable, like listening to music you love when you go to the gym, but most of the times it's just a matter of time until your brain stops asking for the bad things, and begin doing it for the good ones. It's all about habits, habits build our life, you will only need discipline for the first months, but after that it will be something automatic that you will feel strange when you don't do; by my own experience, now it's really hard for me not to exercise, like it could be for you not to brush your teeth. Quality of your habits, define the quality of your life.</p>
