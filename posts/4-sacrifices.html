          <p>Michelangelo used to say: "The sculpture is already in the rock", meaning that you only have to remove what is not important. I honestly like to think that way, we do not have to do more things, we have to do less.</p>

        <h2>Less is more</h2>
        <p>In this moment of the history we're constantly being attacked by ads, social media, news, and a lot of things that just steal our attention, I think that right now there is more people with some kind of attention disorder than never; after all this that I've said, don't you think that somebody who can stay focused has an advantage over a lot of people?, and imagine that person focused in the right things, things that add value to the world, isn't he or she going to be great? Now imagine what our world would be like if at least 30% of the world population were also focused on important things for our society, how would our world be?</p>
        <p>If you are used to those things it may be hard to get out of them, as it's hard to remove the rock that the sculpture doesn't need, but if you can take those things away, you will have a very beautiful sculpture. What I'm trying to say, it's that what you want will define the things that you should be doing on a daily basis, because our time in this world is limited and you cannot do everything.</p>

        <h2>You have to make decisions</h2>
        <p>Broccoli over that chocolate ice cream? Who would make that decision? only weirdos right?, weirdos with an amazing health and body, now it doesn't sound that bad, right?. Every action has a reaction is what some guy used to say, and it is that way, if you push a glass of water it will probably move, if you study instead of gaming, you will probably know more than before; of course I think we will both prefer gaming and eating that chocolate ice cream, but those won't usually have a positive impact in our lifes, and this post's name is "Sacrifices", so now you can see where I'm going.</p>
        <h2>It depends on where you want to go</h2>
        <p>After defining what you want to do everyday, follow that plan, that routine, everyday; that's the way you start making progress, putting a little brick everyday, so you can get that castle at some point. Brick by brick you won't feel like you are doing a lot of effort, but you are, and trust me, after 1000 days putting bricks you will see how big your castle is, and if you continue, it will be even greater.</p>
        <h2>Nobody will cheer you for putting a brick</h2>
        <p>Would you make a post of you spending three hours learning how to code everyday? it is repetitive, people will get tired of that like three days later; the same for you eating those ugly vegetables; boring, boring, boring; even though, those are the things that will give you an amazing skillset and an astonishing body respectively, so you sometimes will feel like it's not important, but that is only your brain's reward system who is really outdated not realizing what the modern era needs are.</p>
        <p>You can always find ways to make those things enjoyable, like listening to music you love when you go to the gym, but most of the times it's just a matter of time until your brain stops asking for the bad things, and begin doing it for the good ones. It's all about habits, habits build our life, you will only need discipline for the first months, but after that it will be something automatic that you will feel strange when you don't do; by my own experience, now it's really hard for me not to exercise, like it could be for you not to brush your teeth. Quality of your habits, define the quality of your life.</p>
