        <h2>A myth that becomes real in our lives</h2>
        <p>In this moment of the history we're constantly being attacked by ads, social media, news, and a lot of things that just steal our attention, I think that right now there is more people with some kind of attention disorder than never; after all this that I've said, don't you think that somebody who can stay focused has an advantage over a lot of people?, and imagine that person focused in the right things, things that add value to the world, isn't he or she going to be great? Now imagine what our world would be like if at least 30% of the world population were also focused on important things for our society, how would our world be?</p>
        <p>If you are used to those things it may be hard to get out of them, as it's hard to remove the rock that the sculpture doesn't need, but if you can take those things away, you will have a very beautiful sculpture. What I'm trying to say, it's that what you want will define the things that you should be doing on a daily basis, because our time in this world is limited and you cannot do everything.</p>

        <h2>You have to make decisions</h2>
        <p>Broccoli over that chocolate ice cream? Who would make that decision? only weirdos, right?, weirdos with an amazing health and body, now it doesn't sound that bad, right?. Every action has a reaction is what some guy used to say, and it is that way, if you push a glass of water it will probably move, if you study instead of gaming, you will probably know more than before; of course I think we will both prefer gaming and eating that chocolate ice cream, but those won't usually have a positive impact in our lifes, and this post's name is "Sacrifices", so now you can see where I'm going.</p>
        <h2>It depends on where you want to go</h2>
        <p>We all want different things, maybe you want to win an Ice cream competition, and in that case maybe you will have to prioritize eating ice cream rather than broccoli; but let's be honest, most of the people want more money and an amazing body, and to achieve those things the path is full of sacrifices, like not eating that ice cream, or spending less time with your friends, less time playing video games, or something like that, that you would prefer doing. They say that if you are not feeling comfortable, you are in the right way (depending on what it is, of course.) but as I was saying it will depend on what you want, if what you want is worth the sacrifice, just do it. </p>
        <h2>You have to be congruent</h2>
        <p>If you say that you want an amazing body, why are you still eating that bad everyday?; do you want more money? then, why do you spend 4 hours a day watching TV?; if you want your family to know you love them, then, why do you never call them?. I hope you can see that usually actions speak louder than words, and that you cannot be taken seriously when you say you are going to do something but do something different.</p>
        <p>You would say "well, most of the people is that way" but tell me, are most of the people earning millions? are most of the people in good shape? are they?. I know it hurts, I also loved video games at some point of my life, ice cream, hot dogs, all that was part of my life, but when you say you want something, you have to be congruent and start acting to get it.</p>
        <p id="call">What are you waiting for? Start acting!</p>
