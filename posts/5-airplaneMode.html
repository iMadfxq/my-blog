        <h2>A myth that becomes real in our lives</h2>
        <p>People and airlines will usually tell you to put your device on airplane mode when you are on a flight, this is because once there was an airplane accident where the investigators concluded that cellphones could've interfered with the airplane's system and caused the accident. Now this has been declared a myth, but even so, people still do it. Now, in our lives, we definitely now how our phone can interfere with our lives and make us lose control, it may be for 30 minutes, but more usually it will destroy all of our day; and let me tell you, our phone is only one of the factors, there are many other things that can interfere with the things we want to do, and stopping us to achieve them, like friends, family, neighbours, etc.</p>

        <h2>Put your life on airplane mode</h2>
        <p>You can start by putting your cellphone on airplane mode and turning off Wi-Fi, at that point you will have ended with most of the distractions you can have in a day, those simple 2 steps, will let you be more focused on whatever you want to do, will increase your productivity a lot and will let you be less stressed. Other thing you can do is talking to the people that you are living with, to not talk to you for a few hours (or whataver amount of time you need), and you will have even less interferences.</p>
        <p>Just be a little careful not to become a hermit; try to communicate in a good manner about what you are doing to the people around you; and if you are expecting some important calls or emails, this would not be a good idea. But if your cellphone is only going to be a distraction, just do it.</p>
        <h2>Put your environment on airplane mode</h2>
        <p>Now we have to get more specific, because it's not only about your cellphone and the people that you are living with, the place where you work or study can also have a lot of interferences, maybe you have some bookmarks on your browser that will take your attention, maybe you have a TV and you feel the impulse to turn it on; look around and make conclusions, start doing changes, start taking away those things that can distract you, so you can have an airplane-moded workspace.</p>
        <h2>It can work backwards too</h2>
        <p>Now you know that the wrong things around you can distract you, but what about putting that important book near your workspace, or maybe those dumbells; don't you think it will become more probably that you start reading , or exercising?. Take advantage of this effect, if something is going to drag your attention, it's better if it's something good.</p>
        <p>Our environment affect our behavior most of the times, so if it's going to happen anyways, why wouldn't you make it work for your benefit?.</p>
