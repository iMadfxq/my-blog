  <p>We've all heard that "You should always accept who you are no matter what"; but today I'm going to bring a more inteligent way to do it.

    Let's imagine that you are fat and you are from the 95% of the world population that doesn't have a hormonal disorder or a related disease; do you think that you should accept that you are fat, love yourself, and start telling people to accept you that way?.
