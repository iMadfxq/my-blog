        </div>
        <h2>Let's look at some examples.</h2>
        <p>Have you ever heard about Paypal? Don't you think it's amazing how we can transfer money trough internet? I know, maybe right now it seems completely normal, but we cannot deny that it was a big step for the way we interact with our money, (Elon Musk). Being able to afFORD a car even though you have low income, normal, but it wouldn't be without what Henry Ford did a few decades ago. Getting that fancy thing you were able to buy without even going out of your house, in two days, that's the rule nowadays, but would we have it without Jeff Bezos?. We can even talk about people like Satoshi Nakamoto, that we don't even know who they are, but that have created amazing things like Bitcoin.</p>
        <h2>What do these people have in common?</h2>
        <p>Well, they all are or were millionares, impacted our lives in a possitive way, and they will be remembered for the future generations. They are only a few of the really influencial people that our world have seen, but let me be honest, they are the greatest but not the only ones that have the power to give something to our world, to our society. They are getting millions because they are helping millions, but our mom or father were also givers to you (I hope) of love and support; your local grocer is also helping the people of your neighbourhood getting food, that person picking up the recycling is contributing with something.</p>
        <p>I really think that overpopulation would not be a problem if all of us were thinking about ways to improve the world, of course, I cannot simplify it that way because there are a lot of factors to think of, but just imagine it. Beautiful, huh?</p>
        <h2>A little is better than nothing</h2>
        <p>Right now, maybe you cannot make a big impact, maybe you cannot change millions of people's lives, but you can give a smile to your parents and tell them you love them; you can give a hug to that friend of yours who needs it, maybe you can give some food to that person that is starving. We can all make little impact, but still full of value.</p>
        <h2>A change in businesses' models</h2>
        <p>Nowadays it's something that you will hear when talking about creating a company or something like that, "you have to impact people's lives", you will hear that "you should give a meaning to your business, some values"; and let me be honest, I'm really glad to see how businesses are now starting with things like that, I really think it's better for all of us. Some will want to be sustainable, some will want to make things cheaper so more people can afford them, some will donate part of their revenue, and many other ways to improve our world.</p>
        <p>I really think we should change a little bit our mindset, stop expecting to be given when you haven't given anything. We should better think about what we are going to give to the people around us, to our environment, to our world.</p>
        <p>Remember, you will get one million dollars, once you've helped one million people.</p>
