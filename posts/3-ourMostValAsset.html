        <h2>It can be worth even more than gold.</h2>
        <p>Your life starts with a negative worth, you depend of your parents, because you can't do anything by yourself (as any baby) you are worth what they can give you, but that gap starts to reduce once you start growing and getting more independent, to the point where you can get a job. Now, let's imagine you work at a restaurant. Who earns the most? the dishwasher or the chef? I mean, they are both important, but who is harder to replace and who adds more value to the restaurant?. The chef knows more about the recipes, is making the food people go to the restaurant for, and has all the skills required to operate knives and can do it's job in less time than anyone else, and what about an engineer who can make a robot that can prepare food even faster, never makes mistakes and requires a one time payment instead of a salary?. Dishwasher, chef or engineer; Who gets more money for one hour of their time?</p>
        <p>As you saw, the one who can do the most,and knows more is the one who gets more money. So knowledge is what can make your time be worth gold or even diamonds, you just have to invest it in yourself, learning more useful things so you can add value to the world, the more you learn, the more you will be able to do, and with every thing that you do, you could be helping people in our society, and by helping people is how you can get money, if you can help 1 million people in the world, you will probably can get $1 million dollars or even more.</p>
        <h2>Make a plan to get it</h2>
        <p>Your plan at least should make sense for you, that's all, there are usually not risks involved in any of the things we do, so don't spend too much time making the plan, start acting as soon as possible, that's the real thing, act</p>
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>After defining what you want, this is the most important thing. Because you have a vision, now you know where all your actions should be focused on. If you want more money, you will better start making businesses, learning how to do it, getting more skills, etc. So act, act, act, the most important thing for that is the vision which will give you the motivation to do it, you will be improving you shitty plan while you are on the move, the experience will help you to improve that plan, and that's the magic with it. You have no risks, act.</p>
        <h2>You can eat an elephant if you do it little by little</h2>
        <p>Do you think you can eat a whole elephant in only one meal? And, what about eating a small chunk everyday for 1 month? Which way do you think it will be easier?. The same is for your goals and the things you want, it is way easier if you do it everyday little by little, increasing the effort you do little by little (Like when you are accelerating a car, so it doesn't pull you back), start doing 5 minutes of exercise everyday, after 1 month you can do 10 minutes, after 6 months start doing 30, you will build an habit, which is one of the most powerful tools you have to achieve whatever you want.</p>
        <p>Also, usually the things that will make you great won't be glamorous, they won't be amazing; they are usually very boring things that after some time doing them they will give amazing results; I'm talking about those small actions like doing 30 minutes of exercise everyday for 2 years, maybe you will not notice anything in the first 6 months, but you have to keep going and going and going, even though you see nothing, because in 2 years you'll notice a change; nobody will be cheering you everyday for just going to the gym 30 minutes, but even though, it is a really important step to achieve your goals.</p>
        <p id="call">What are you waiting for? Start acting!</p>
