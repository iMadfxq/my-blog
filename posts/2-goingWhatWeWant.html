          <p>I think we all have heard that we should accept and love ourselves the way we are, and don't get me wrong, there are some cases where that's the way it should be, but in some others, that's just stopping us to get to our best self.</p>

        <h2>How to think</h2>
        <p>There will always be some things we cannot change, like our height or our appearance; even though we can definitely do some things to improve them, we cannot change them, so the love yourself technique would be useful in those situations, but there are some other things that you can totally change, like the people you are living with, what you eat, what you do everyday, the things you watch or even how you decide to see things, and those can have a massive impact in your life.</p>
        <p>We should learn how to differenciate those 2, what we can and what we can't change, because after that you would be able to accept what you can't change, and start changing what you can and want to change. You will also save a lot of energy by stop worrying about those things you can't change (you can't make her love you), and will be becoming your best self, by improving those that you want.</p>
        <p>I will give you 2 lists, one with things you can change, and another with the ones you can't</p>
        <section class="main__text--lists">
          <h3>Things we can't change</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The country where you were born</li>
            <li>Your genetics (Certain things of your appearance, muscle mass you can achieve naturally, height)</li>
            <li>If a person loves you or not (Even though you can become an atractive person by working on yourself, not everyone will like you)</li>
            <li>Things like the weather</li>
            <li>The way other people act (It's always easier to change yourself than others)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Things we can change</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Our knowledge and skillset</li>
            <li>The people we live with</li>
            <li>Our goals and the way we act to achieve them</li>
            <li>Our attitude</li>
            <li>How we treat people</li>
            <li>Our bodyweight</li>
            <li>The things we eat</li>
            <li><a href="./3-ourMostValAsset.html" target="_blank">The way we use our time</a></li>
            <li>Our actions</li>
          </ul>  
        </section>
        <p>I think you can clearly see that there are a lot more things we can change than the ones we can't.
