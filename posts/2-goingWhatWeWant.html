        <h2>Define what you want.</h2>
        <p>Aim for the stars, maybe you will get only to the moon, but isn't it better that aiming to the ground?. Always think big, but at the same time be realistic, you will not get 1 trillion dollars tomorrow morning, even though you start acting right now it is incredibly improbable; so let's say you will get them in 30 years, that way you will start doing little things everyday to achieve that, maybe learning about economics, finance, etc; and you will be going for it; maybe you will only get 10 billion, but isn't it better than nothing?. Also when you feel that something is really improbable you will lose motivation really fast, it will be incredibly difficult to keep going for it; it's way easier when you at least feel that is possible.</p>
        <p>Once you know what I explained above, create a vision, that's defining where you would like to be, maybe spending more time with your family, making more money, buying that BMW M2 series, or whatever desire you have, think about it, it should always be clear in your mind.</p>
        <h2>Make a plan to get it</h2>
        <p>Your plan at least should make sense for you, that's all, there are usually not risks involved in any of the things we do, so don't spend too much time making the plan, start acting as soon as possible, that's the real thing, act</p>
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>After defining what you want, this is the most important thing. Because you have a vision, now you know where all your actions should be focused on. If you want more money, you will better start making businesses, learning how to do it, getting more skills, etc. So act, act, act, the most important thing for that is the vision which will give you the motivation to do it, you will be improving you shitty plan while you are on the move, the experience will help you to improve that plan, and that's the magic with it. You have no risks, act.</p>
        <h2>You can eat an elephant if you do it little by little</h2>
        <p>Do you think you can eat a whole elephant in only one meal? And, what about eating a small chunk everyday for 1 month? Which way do you think it will be easier?. The same is for your goals and the things you want, it is way easier if you do it everyday little by little, increasing the effort you do little by little (Like when you are accelerating a car, so it doesn't pull you back), start doing 5 minutes of exercise everyday, after 1 month you can do 10 minutes, after 6 months start doing 30, you will build an habit, which is one of the most powerful tools you have to achieve whatever you want.</p>
        <p>Also, usually the things that will make you great won't be glamorous, they won't be amazing; they are usually very boring things that after some time doing them they will give amazing results; I'm talking about those small actions like doing 30 minutes of exercise everyday for 2 years, maybe you will not notice anything in the first 6 months, but you have to keep going and going and going, even though you see nothing, because in 2 years you'll notice a change; nobody will be cheering you everyday for just going to the gym 30 minutes, but even though, it is a really important step to achieve your goals.</p>
        <p id="call">What are you waiting for? Start acting!</p>
